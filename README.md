## Mike Gleicher's GitHub Home

You probably want to see my [home page](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gleicher/) which is also a [GitHub Page](https://gleicher.github.io/).

Most useful repositories are part of the [UW Graphics Organization](https://github.com/uwgraphics).
There are also special purpose organizations for classes.
